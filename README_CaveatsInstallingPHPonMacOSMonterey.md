Ridiculously, and infuriatingly: Apple, for whatever reasons, decided to take what is an excellent working PHP installation on all MacOS versions between 10.13 (High Sierra) and 11.x.x (Big Sur), and simply destroy it for MacOS Monterey (12.x.x).  (It appears to me that Apple paid people *explicitly to break PHP functionality in MacOS Monterey* -- and also expresses the intention of doing so in future MacOS versions as well!  And they did this thoroughly enough that users must now employ a number of tricks to properly install and enable it.)  A lengthy and useful guide to PHP reinstallation in Monterey can be found [here](https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-monterey-apache-multiple-php-versions).  However .... like most such guides, that guide contains a number of errors, some falsehoods, some misleading statements, some things that seem unnecessary but are actually entirely necessary, some things that seem necessary but are actually entirely unnecessary, and several "10% truths" :

Firstly, per the unfortunate title of that guide: Why on Earth would one ever want *multiple* different PHP installations on one's computer?  The answer to that (certainly at least here) is that one *wouldn't* -- one only needs *one* working PHP installation, and one only wants *one* working PHP installation, on one's computer.  So, please ignore the title of that guide -- when you get to the point in the guide (which is, unavoidably, fairly far down) of actually installing PHP itself, then please just install the PHP version 7.4 that it suggests, and please ignore (i.e., don't install) both the older *and the more recent* PHP versions than 7.4 that are also included in the guide.

More to come soon.
