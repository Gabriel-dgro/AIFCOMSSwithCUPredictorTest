Ridiculously, and infuriatingly (at least in my view): Apple, for whatever reasons, decided to take what is an excellent working PHP installation on all MacOS versions between 10.13 (High Sierra) and 11.x.x (Big Sur), and simply destroy it for MacOS Monterey (12.x.x).  (It appears to me that Apple paid its MacOS software engineers *explicitly to break PHP functionality in MacOS Monterey* -- and Apple also expresses the intention of doing so in future MacOS versions as well!  And they did this thoroughly enough that users must now employ a number of tricks to properly install and enable PHP.)  A lengthy and useful guide to PHP reinstallation in Monterey can be found [here](https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-monterey-apache-multiple-php-versions).  *However* .... like most such software installation guides, that guide contains a number of errors, some falsehoods, some misleading statements, some things that seem unnecessary but are actually entirely necessary, some things that seem necessary but are actually entirely unnecessary, and several "10% truths" :

Firstly, per the unfortunate title of that guide: Why on Earth would one ever want *multiple* different PHP installations on one's computer?  The answer to that (certainly at least here) is that one *wouldn't* -- one only needs ***one*** working PHP installation, and one only wants ***one*** working PHP installation, on one's computer.  So, please just ignore the title of that guide -- when you get to the point in the guide (which is, unavoidably, fairly far down) of actually installing PHP itself, then please just install the PHP version 7.4 that it suggests, and please ignore (i.e., don't install) both the older *and the more recent* PHP versions than 7.4 that are also included in the guide.  You **won't want** the most recent PHP 8.x.  **You only want PHP 7.4**.

Secondly (and from now on, I'll be going in order down from the top of that [page](https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-monterey-apache-multiple-php-versions)), if you're like me and forget/overlook the requirement near the top of that page to set whether you're using an Apple (ARM) CPU (M1 or M2), or (like me) have an Intel CPU-based Mac, you will *very seriously* regret such an overlook...  This is because, for whatever other reasons, Apple decided to use CPU hardware as the deciding factor for whether to put all Homebrew-built software package code into subdirectories of /usr/local/etc/ (which it does for all Intel CPU-based Macs, and as had always been done previously), or else into subdirectories of a new directory named /opt/homebrew/etc/ (which it does for new Apple CPU-based Macs).  (What that particular software directory name choice has to do with CPU hardware -- i.e., ***absolutely nothing*** -- is beyond everyone except Apple software engineering management, who 100% violated the critical principle of when a software change absolutely must be made, then one should bite the bullet and make it universally, and don't tie it to some unrelated criterion such as what type of CPU someone is running on, if the change is completely unrelated to CPU architecture.)  So, just be absolutely sure to choose the position of that switch near the top of that page correctly.

Thirdly: You might think that you already have XCode command line tools and/or Homebrew installed, because you just upgraded to Monterey from a previous MacOS version, and you had one or both of those installed before you upgraded.  You *don't*.  You will need to start with those sections exactly like someone who is starting with a fresh new MacOS Monterey computer would: those tools get deprecated every time one upgrades one's MacOS at least a full version, so they need to be completely reinstalled.  So, do those sections (like most other things in the guide) in their entirety, before attempting anything below them.

Fourthly:
