Ridiculously ... Apple, for whatever reasons, decided to take what is an excellent working PHP installation on all MacOS versions between 10.13 (High Sierra) and 11.x.x (Big Sur), and just destroy it for MacOS Monterey (12.x.x).  (It appears to me that Apple paid people *explicitly to break PHP functionality in MacOS Monterey*.  And they did this thoroughly enough that users must now employ a number of tricks to properly install and enable it.)  A lengthy and useful guide to PHP reinstallation in Monterey can be found [here](https://getgrav.org/blog/macos-monterey-apache-multiple-php-versions).  However .... like most such guides, it contains a number of errors, some falsehoods, some misleading statements, some things that seem unnecessary but are actually entirely necessary, some things that seem necessary but are actually entirely unnecessary, and some "10% truths" :

More to come soon.
